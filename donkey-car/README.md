# Donkey Self-Driving Car

This instructable shows off how to create a [DYI Robocar](http://diyrobocars.com/) forked off of the ["Donkey"](http://www.donkeycar.com/) Self-Driving car platform using the OpenMV Cam instead of the RaspberryPi. You can see the car in action in this video [here](http://youtu.be/Pm88BEz3upM).
