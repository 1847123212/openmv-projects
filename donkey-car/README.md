# Donkey Self-Driving Car

This instructable shows off how to create a [DYI Robocar](http://diyrobocars.com/) forked off of the ["Donkey"](http://www.donkeycar.com/) Self-Driving car platform using the OpenMV Cam instead of the RaspberryPi. You can see the car in action in this video [here](http://youtu.be/Pm88BEz3upM).

## Parts

The OpenMV Cam Donkey Car is designed to be easy to build out of parts that you can buy online and assemble together with basic tools. Below is the list of essential parts you'll need to build the self-driving car.

Optionally, for better performance I recommend that you purchase the follow parts so you can use LiPo batteries with your self-driving car versus the NiMh battery the Magnet Car comes with which has a shorter run time.
